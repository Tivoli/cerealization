# Cerealization

Hey folks, this is just your every day, normal, do-it-yourself kinda home
serailization speed testing tool kit.  Just clone the repo, install any
necessary requirements and run just 1 (that's right, just 1!) command to
git-r-done.

So what we got here is a python script that runs multiple types of
serialization.  It knows how to do json in like five diffr'nt which ways.
And it knows it how to do pickled output too.  (Them suckers taste DELICIOUS).
But it also knows how to do tnetstring's too.

If you don't know about tnetstrings just send your internet location to
[tnetstring.org](http://tnetstring.org/) and give it a look or two.


## Act Now!

Now, I'm gonna tell you just how we do it in a moment...  But first! I want to
let you know about a limited time offer.

I'm just so excited about this!

Right now, for a limited time, I'm gonna give you not just one, but TWO (!)
cerailization files.  The first one is the speed testing Python like we
discussed but the second one adds some Node.js to the experience!

You too can see that Python's ultrajson and Ryan Kelly and Zed Shaw's
tnetstring serialization is faster than Node.js.  GIT R DONE!


# Gitting R Done At Home

You just gotta git this here repo on your computer or your laptop of what have
you and so just go right ahead and clone this here repo.

Go on now.

    $ cd ~/Desktop/
    $ git clone https://github.com/j2labs/cerealization.git
    $ cd cerealization

OK.  Now for folks along with me at home, just install them Python
requirements like this here.

    $ pip install -I -r ./py.reqs

And maybe you still gotta install Node.js.  They can describe how thats done
better than me: [Installing Node.js](https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Installing-Node.js-via-package-manager) 

You ready to git it done right good?

    $ python cereal.py
    ...

    $ node cereal.js
    ...
